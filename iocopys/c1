Love is the most beautiful thing in the world, it gives people the power and make them become stronger. In most children's eyes, they dream to have the relationship like their parents, who support each other all the time. This is the best love.

爱是世界上最美丽的东西,它给人力量,让他们变得更强。在大多数孩子的眼里,他们梦想着拥有像他们的父母那样的爱情,相互支持。这是最好的爱。

I read a good story that told about a married couple. The wife read from a magazine that listing the unsatisfied problems between the couples could help them to keep their marriage better. So they listed the problems on a separated room. The wife was the first to talked about the unsatisfied problems, it surprised the husband that she got three pages. When it was the turn for the husband to read the problems, he got nothing in the paper. He told his wife that she was the most perfect girl in his heart and he didn't want the girl change a thing.

我读到一个好故事,讲述一对已婚夫妇。妻子从一本杂志上读到,列出夫妻之间不满意的问题可以帮助他们更好地维持他们的婚姻。所以他们在分开的房间里写了出来。妻子是第一个谈到了不满意的问题,丈夫很意外,她竟然写有三页。当轮到丈夫说出问题时,他什么也没写。他对他的妻子说,在他心里她是最完美的女孩,他不想让这个女孩改变任何一件事情。

What a lovely couple, the husband shows people what love is. Love is to accept one's good sides and bad sides, no matter what happens, they will always support each other. Just as the vow, no matter you are rich or poor, sick or healthy, we will never be aparted.

多么可爱的夫妇啊,丈夫告诉人们什么是爱。爱是接受一个人的好和坏,不管发生什么,他们总是互相支持。正如誓言,不管你是富人还是穷人,生病或健康,我们永远不会分开。
